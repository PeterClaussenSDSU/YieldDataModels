> This analysis is in contrast to more a commonly used method. In [@anselin.l-08-2004] and [@bongiovanni.r-2007] the field is analyzed as a lattice of 9.8 $\times$ 9.8 meter squares, although [@scharf.p-2005] argue that a 20m length is minimum for robust yield prediction, while [@kyveryga.p-01-2013] used 35m quadrats. The lattice may be rotated from true north to match the direction of planting. In [@anselin.l-08-2004] this reduces a set 8288 point estimates of yield to 1738 polygons. Anselin suggest this reduces errors associated with GPS yield monitor data. Bongiovanni [@bongiovanni.r-2007] present a more detailed discussion of the processes and errors associated with yield monitor data.
